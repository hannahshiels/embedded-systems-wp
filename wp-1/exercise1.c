// Write  a  program  that  reads  in  an  integer  number  between  1  and  5  from  the  keyboard  and
// prints  out  one  of existing five sentences on the console depending on what number was entered. You can invent the sentences
// as you want, but each sentence should be unique.

// The program continues to ask for a new number and exits if number isn ÃÅt in the interval 1 to 5.
