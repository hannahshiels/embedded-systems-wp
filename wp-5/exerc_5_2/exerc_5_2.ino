/**
 * Create a system based on Arduino Uno or Arduino Yun, which measures the temperature and lids the LEDs. You should use
 * 5 LEDs for the temperature measurement. The LEDs should be turned on depending on the temperature â€“ e.g. for 0-10
 * degrees Celsius, 1 LED is turned on; for 11-20, 2 LEDs are turned on, and so on.

//-------Defines----------
#define CLOCK_SPEED 16000000// Clock speed of the Arduino Uno
#define PRESCALER 1024      // used for dictating speed of timer according to (timer speed (Hz)) = (Arduino clock speed (16MHz)) / prescaler
#define INTERRUPT_FREQ 1    // define interrupt frequency
#define TEMPERATURE_PIN 0  // the pin that connects the temperature sensor to the board
#define BIT_RESOLUTION 10   // the resolution of the value that is read via analogue pin
#define VOLTAGE 5.0          // the voltage of the board

//-------Parameters----------
int timer = 0;        // The interrupt timer value is saved in this variable
float read = 0.0;     // The value that is measured by the sensor is saved here
float voltage = 0.0;  // The equivalent voltage value of the sensor read is saved here
float temperature = 0.0;   // The temperature degree in Celsius
